## Catapult HLS C++ code
This is the C++ part of the hls4ml Catapult backend. It has been moved from the `hls4ml-catapult-template` GitHub repository, which is now archived and available at https://github.com/maksgraczyk/hls4ml-catapult-template.

The code is based on https://github.com/ruishi31/hls4ml/tree/catapult-backend/hls4ml/templates/catapult.
